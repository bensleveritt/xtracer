It was developed under the supervision of Prof. T. Panayiotopoulos as \r\npart of the research work of the Knowledge Engineering Lab (KEL).\r\n\r\nv1.x is currently under development as part of my dissertation for the MSc of\r\ncomputer graphics programming at the University of Hull.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nThe source code is distributed under the LGPL license version 3 or later.\r\n\r\nVersion history\r\n---------------\r\n0.7\t\t2866bf99ca04d84a85ab13b755ded7d42014bee7\r\n1.x\t\tHEAD\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\nImplemented:\r\n* Primitives    : Plane, Triangle, Sphere, Mesh\r\n* Materials     : Lambert, Phong, Blinn-Phong\r\n* Lights        : Point, Sphere, Box, Triangle\r\n* Cameras       : Pinhole, Thin lense\r\n* Shading       : Reflection (glossy & perfect mirror), Refraction,\r\n\t\t\t\t  Depth of field, Soft shadows, Texture mapping\r\n* Acceleration  : Threads, Octrees, KD-trees\r\n* Anti-aliasing : Supersampling\r\n* Rendering     : HDR, Whitted/Distributed raytracing, Photon mapping (diffuse term)\r\n\r\nFuture expansion:\r\n* Shading\t\t: Fresnel, Beer's law\r\n* Anti-aliasing\t: Adaptive SS, Jittering\r\n\r\nCompilation / Installation\r\n--------------------------\r\nThe source code is distributed along with a makefile configuration script for unix based\r\nsystems with a GNU toolchain installed. To view all the available configuration options\r\ntype: ./configure --help. Once the configuration is done, you can build the binary by \r\ntyping: make. To install the binary in your system type: make install. To uninstall \r\ntype: make uninstall\r\n\r\nFor windows users, a visual studio 2010 solution is available in the ide directory.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n* openmp\tMust be provided by your compiler.\r\n* libnmath\thttps://github.com/4rknova/libnmath\r\n* libnmesh\thttps://github.com/4rknova/libnmesh\r\n* linimg\thttps://github.com/4rknova/libnimg\r\n* libncf\thttps://github.com/4rknova/libncf\r\n\r\nSupported platforms\r\n-------------------\r\nxtracer should be able to compile and run on any system equipped with openmp compatible\r\nc and c++ compilers. It has been tested without any problems under the following platforms:\r\n\r\n* Linux           \r\n* FreeBSD\r\n* MacOSX\r\n* MS Windows XP, 7\r\n\r\nContributions\r\n-------------\r\nI would like to thank the following people for their help and support.\r\n\r\nversion 0.x\r\n\r\n\tProf. T.
